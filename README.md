### Business understanding
This dashboard provides an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. It is intended to help decision-makers understand the current state of the pandemic, track trends over time, and identify areas of concern.

Specific goals :-

- Track the trends in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India.
- Identify areas of India that are most affected by the virus.
- Monitor the effectiveness of vaccination efforts.
- Provide data to support decision-making about resource allocation and public health interventions.

Target audience :-

- Policymakers
- Public health officials
- Researchers
- The general public

### Key Components

- Map of India :- The map shows the distribution of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across India. Using color-coding for easy identification of hotspots visually representing the severity of the outbreak in different regions.
- Monitoring Confirmed Cases, Recoveries, and Fatalities :- This graph shows trends over time for each metric, allowing for comparison and analysis of the pandemic's progression.
- Statewise Mortality :- This section displays a table with the number of confirmed cases and deaths for each state and union territory in India.
- Timeline :- The timeline shows the trend in confirmed cases and deaths over time for all of India.
- Vaccine Dosing Chart :- This chart show the number of vaccine doses administered by vaccine type (Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V)
- Age Group Details :- This table shows the breakdown of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths by age group.
- ICMR testing lab :- This section shows the number of COVID-19 tests conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) labs across different states.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the data to answer key questions, such as :-
- What is the current state of COVID-19 in India?
- Which states are most affected?
- What is the vaccination rate in India?
- What are some of the challenges India faces in managing the pandemic?
- What does the future hold for COVID-19 in India?
- Which age groups in India are most affected by COVID-19?
- What are the factors that may be driving the increase in confirmed cases?
- How is testing being conducted in India? Is the testing rate high enough to capture all cases?

Here are some of the key takeaways from the dashboard :-

- India has a total of over 450 million confirmed cases, with over 500,000 deaths. While the number of new cases has declined significantly compared to previous peaks, the pandemic is still ongoing.
- Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka have consistently reported the highest number of cases and deaths throughout the pandemic. The map on the dashboard effectively highlights these states with darker shades.
- The dashboard shows that over 62 million vaccine doses have been administered, with over 61% of the population receiving at least one dose and over 12% fully vaccinated. This vaccination drive has likely contributed to the decline in new cases.
- The vast geographical size and diverse population make it difficult to implement uniform control measures. Additionally, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation remain challenges in rural areas.
- The emergence of new variants and the potential for waning immunity necessitate continued vigilance and adaptation of public health measures. Continued vaccination efforts and effective surveillance remain crucial for controlling the pandemic.
- The highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is in the 18-35 age group, followed by the 36-49 age group
- Holiday season, New variants, Waning immunity, Relaxation of restrictions are the factors that may be driving the increase in confirmed cases.
- India has significantly increased nationwide testing, surpassing 600 million tests as of August 2023. While testing rates vary between states, the overall testing volume exceeds confirmed cases, indicating substantial efforts to capture positive cases, though potential underdetection in specific demographics remains a consideration.

### Challenges
Some potential challenges faced while creating this dashboard includes :-

Data Challenges :-

- Data cleaning :- removing unwanted data & null values, filling blank values and formating.
- Data accuracy :- Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data was crucial for reliable analysis.

Visualization Challenges :-

- Not to overload information.
- Aligning with user goals.
- Visualization :- Choosing the right charts and graphs to effectively represent complex data and avoid overwhelming the user was difficult.
- User interface :- The dashboard needs to be easy to use for all. The design needs to be sure that the layout is intuitive and that the user can easily find the information they need.

### Future enhancements

- Add a news feed.
- Mobile-friendly design.
- Social media integration.

### Status
